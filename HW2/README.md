This homework was about the collection, manipulation and analysis of data from a large database
I learnt how to change the datatype of our datavalues. I also learnt how to insert a new column into an existing database.
I mostly worked with Rodiat Bolaji.
Though it was an equal collaboaration, I mostly contributed to the collection of data and the formatting of our codes.
