This homework was all about the different ways and packages we can use to find the regression line of a set of data.
This is one of the homeworks I've felt more confident in. I learnt how to use a lot of new packages(sklearn, ols..) and got more familiar with some others I've seen before(numpy).
I worked alone for the majority or all of the homework. I and rodiat came together to do the extra credit.
