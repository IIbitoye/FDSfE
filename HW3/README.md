This homework was about probablities. We had to come up with a hypothesis we wanted to prove, set a probability threshold of the null hypothesis of our main idea, and then solve to check if we reject the null hypothesis or not.
I learned a lot of new things in this homework. I learnt how to set a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and I learnt about p-values, k tests and t tests and what they tell us about our dataset.
I worked with Chinyere and Valerie for the most part. I also had some discussions with Rodiat and Ada regarding the assignment.
I worked alone when it came to setting the null and alternative hypothesis,and the interpretation of the graphs and k and t tests, so I lead in those parts.
